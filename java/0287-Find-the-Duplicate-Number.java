Problem Statement:

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), 
prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, 
find the duplicate one.

Example:

    Example 1:

    Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
    Output: 2

    Example 2:

    Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
    Output: 3

/*

Thought Process:

Since each integer is between 1 and n

Final thoughts:

Time complexity: O()
Space complexity: O()
